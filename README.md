#Build the flacoin-new-fork



#Communication note FLA




I come on behalf of the FlaCoin Team Communicating to all the US that our currency had to be Forked,
 
as the Currency Blockchain no longer moved and no new blocks were generated. So we decided to Create a

Coin Fork and we reduced its Maximum Coin Amount from 40 billion to 21 million and the Currency

Premine also had a reduction before it was 30 billion now and 1 million FLA Premine.



#NOTE....





All Old Holders shall Switch to the new FLA. the burrow will be as follows:

THE SWAP WILL BE IN THE PROPORTION 100,000 X 1

that is; Every 100,000 Old FLA is worth 1 New FLA. who

Prove that you have your old FLA Coins and want

to change so call me on Discord
